        <p class = "question">What UI elements did I see and/or interact with while finding, comparing, selecting, and configuring the specific product?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Top navigation bar, with links to 'Home,' 'About,' 'Shop,' 'Cart,' and 'Sign In'.</li>
            <li>Product categories on a left side bar with option to select a specific category.</li>
            <li>Breadcrumb navigation bar; for example: Products/Light/Table Lamps</li>
            <li>Search bar below breadcrmb nav bar and above product gallery.</li>
            <li>Product gallery: Relatively large images for each product and minimal information. 
                Each product only contains the product ID, cost, and a shopping cart icon that appears when 
                you hover over the image.
            </li>
            <li>Product detail page: opens when you click on an item. Clean, minimalist layout with 
                image gallery (vertical) on the very left, the larger selected image in the center, 
                and the item title, price, quantity descriptor, and Add to Cart button on the right.
                Below this basic information is a short product descriptor, followed by recommendations
                and a footer.
            </li>
