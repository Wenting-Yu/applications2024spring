        <h4>Item: lamp</h4>
        <p class = "question">What UI elements did I see and/or interact with while finding, comparing, selecting, and configuring the specific product?</p>
        <ul class = "answer">
            <li>Top navigation bar, with links to 'Home,' 'About,' 'Shop,' 'Cart,' and 'Sign In'.</li>
            <li>Product categories on a left side bar with option to select a specific category.</li>
            <li>Breadcrumb navigation bar; for example: Products/Light/Table Lamps</li>
            <li>Search bar below breadcrmb nav bar and above product gallery.</li>
            <li>Product gallery: Relatively large images for each product and minimal information. 
                Each product only contains the product ID, cost, and a shopping cart icon that appears when 
                you hover over the image.
            </li>
            <li>Product detail page: opens when you click on an item. Clean, minimalist layout with 
                image gallery (vertical) on the very left, the larger selected image in the center, 
                and the item title, price, quantity descriptor, and Add to Cart button on the right.
                Below this basic information is a short product descriptor, followed by recommendations
                and a footer.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class = "question">Have I seen this UI element before in other contexts?</p>
        <p class = "answer">The Sowden website follows the basic online shopping format that I've
            seen in many other online shopping websites. Certain elements, such as the breadcrumb 
            navigation, are also commonly seen in other contexts such as elearning modules, where 
            this type of place-finding is helpful to determine which lesson you are in within a course. 
        </p>
        <p class = "question">Did I know what this element would do before I interacted 
            with it? Why?</p>
        <p class = "answer"> Yes, these elements were all quite intuitive. Going back to the breadcrumb
            navigation, even if its style was different (ex: using slashes rather than arrows), because
            it draws on the titles of pages I have seen before within the website, I could understand
            that this was providing a map of my course through the website.
        </p>
        <p class = "question">What general problem is this element designed to handle?</p>
        <p class = "answer"> The breadcrumb navigation provides a sense of place for the user, so that they
            understand which specific category they are browsing, as well as broader contexts that are 
            available to explore.
        </p>
        <p class = "question">Why was it used in this context? Is it successful?</p>
        <p class = "answer"> In the online shopping context, such a wayfinding navigation bar is helpful especially
            because Sowden is quie niche and sells are seemingly random selection of products, from 
            lamps, to waterbottles, to backpacks.

            Thriftbooks</a></h2>
        <h4>Item: used book</h4>
        <p class = "question">What UI elements did I see and/or interact with while finding, comparing, selecting, and configuring the specific product?</p>
        <ul class = "answer">
            <li>Top navigation bar immediately provides ways for users to filter, including a search bar and sorting options.</li>
            <li>Log in, favorites, and shopping cart icons/buttons in the top right corner.</li>
            <li>The home page is much more overwhelming than that of Sowden, with a dense catalogue of book covers sorted by
                categories such as 'Trending' and 'Under $50,' as well as by different genres.
            </li>
            <li>Once you narrow down a category, there are even more options to filter with a left side bar for book qualities 
                (ex: hardcover, condition, language).
            </li>
            <li>Product gallery: Presented as a list with the book image, information (title, author, ISBN, release date, etc.), 
                format, price, and Add to Cart button. The Add to Cart button is relatively large and encased in bright yellow.
            </li>
            <li>Product detail page: opens when you click on an item. Also much more densely packed with information. Includes 
                buttons to select specific format and condition of the title, customer reviews, and an option to peek inside the book.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class = "question">Have I seen this UI element before in other contexts?</p>
        <p class = "answer">The thriftbooks website is formatted similarly to a library's website, but with additional 
            functions specific to its purpose as an online store. For instance, it is presented as a catalogue with
            sections that one would expect in a library, but has the specific pricing and cart details highlighted.
        </p>
        <p class = "question">Did I know what this element would do before I interacted 
            with it? Why?</p>
        <p class = "answer"> An interesting UI element that I noticed was how many clickable text links there were in every
            part of the product details page. For instance, if a book was part of a series, the series title was a link to
            more books in that series, and the author's name was also clickable to more books by that author and a short author bio.
            Because the linked text is in a different color, it is clear that it performs a different function than other text. 
        </p>
        <p class = "question">What general problem is this element designed to handle?</p>
        <p class = "answer"> This helps generate increased interest in purchasing more books beyond just the one item
            that the user is already browsing.
        </p>
        <p class = "question">Why was it used in this context? Is it successful?</p>
        <p class = "answer"> These clickable links help spur the user to keep exploring further book options to hopefully 
            get them to add and buy more books. It is successful because it allows the user to start on one page/item 
            that they already know a little about and gets them going so that they keep browsing.

        <h4>Item: t-shirt</h4>
        <p class = "question">What UI elements did I see and/or interact with while finding, comparing, selecting, and configuring the specific product?</p>
        <ul class = "answer">
            <li>Top navigation bar, with links to product categories like 'Women'and 'Men,' and a shopping car and favorites icon.</li>
            <li>Home page displays currently featured products and deals.</li>
            <li>There are additional icons floating on the bottom of the page for Home, Search, and Profile</li>
            <li>Breadcrmb nav bar: UNIQLO / Women / Tops / T-shirts</li>
            <li>Product gallery: Four items per row. Each item with image of model, product title, price, and reviews, as well as a heart
                icon to like and save a product. Filtering options above the gallery.
            </li>
            <li>Product detail page: opens when you click on an item. Product title, review, and brief description at top of page. 
                Image gallery (vertical) on the very left, the larger selected image in the center, 
                and the product specifics (color, size, price) and Add to Cart button on the right.
                Below this basic information is a short product descriptor including materials, followed by recommendations, style hints,
                and reviews.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class = "question">Have I seen this UI element before in other contexts?</p>
        <p class = "answer">The Uniqlo website also follows the basic layout for online clothing websites. Thus, the website
            is organized quite intuitively. 
        </p>
        <p class = "question">Did I know what this element would do before I interacted 
            with it? Why?</p>
        <p class = "answer"> The filtering and sorting buttons were particularly intuitive and helped to narrow the search down.
        </p>
        <p class = "question">What general problem is this element designed to handle?</p>
        <p class = "answer"> These filtering options help reduce choice overload by limiting the options visible.
        </p>
        <p class = "question">Why was it used in this context? Is it successful?</p>
        <p class = "answer"> The clear filtering options are successful, especially because the toggle changes to whatever 
            filter you selected so that you remember what you clicked.

        <h2><a href="https://www.loadedboards.com/collections/longboard-decks-and-completes" target="_blank">
            Loaded Boards</a></h2>
        <h4>Item: longboard</h4>
        <p class = "question">What UI elements did I see and/or interact with while finding, comparing, selecting, and configuring the specific product?</p>
        <ul class = "answer">
            <li>The home page carried a distinct design but I was able to quickly find and click the 
                section to bring me to shop for boards.</li>
            <li>Within boards, the left navigation bar included longboard specific details for filtering,
                including disciplines (dancing, distance, mini, freeride, etc.). Additional filtering
                options included wheel size, weight, truck mounting, and length.</li>
            <li>Product gallery: The products are presented simply with only their name, length, and reviews. 
                Notably, no immediate mention of price.
            </li>
            <li>Product detail page: opens when you click on an item. The second image contains specs such as length and width
                markings. A nice additional feature is a section saying "It's right for you if..." with specific
                product details and characteristics. There is also a section with videos showing the board in action.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class = "question">Have I seen this UI element before in other contexts?</p>
        <p class = "answer">The Loaded Boards sight definitely still has the core online shopping format, but 
            includes specific details that would help a user make a more informed decision on a longboard. 
        </p>
        <p class = "question">Did I know what this element would do before I interacted 
            with it? Why?</p>
        <p class = "answer"> The embedded videos were a nice touch and very intuitive to use; all I had to do 
            was click on the red play button and the video started.
        </p>
        <p class = "question">What general problem is this element designed to handle?</p>
        <p class = "answer"> All of the details helped to build a better picture of the user and the board being a good
            match, allowing the user to really visualize themselves with the board.
        </p>
        <p class = "question">Why was it used in this context? Is it successful?</p>
        <p class = "answer"> This is quite successful because it gives the user more certainty in their
            understanding of the product so that they feel they know what they are getting when they make 
            the purchase.
