        <h2>User 1</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The green color seemed slightly random and a little garish. Either add more color or implement the green
                more intentionally throughout the page.</li>
            <li>The numbers in the gear could be larger for clarity.</li>
            <li>For the categories section, implement a hover state for each section. The text over the images should
                have a higher contrast for clarity. Additionally, the sale section could use an image.</li>
            <li>Implement a hover state for each product image, especially for the compare button.</li>
            <li>The page numbering system is confusing.</li>

        <h2>User 2</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The bike buyer guide looks visually similar to the bike finder quiz, so they can easily get confused.
            </li>
            <li>Within the quiz, some of the questions and options were unclear. For budget, actual price ranges would
                work better than the current options. Instead of 'more specific requirements', use 'additional
                considerations'.</li>

        <h2>Abe's feedback</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Bike configurator tool or Bike visualizer, video game style. This is an idea with potential, and one
                that I will try to explore such that the idea can be well communicated.</li>
