        <h2>Sophie</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>There was some confusion about what the button icons in the gear do within the featured bikes section.
                It was not clear that this was a rotating carousel of featured bikes.</li>
            <li>She first tried chose one of categories from home, but was stopped because there was no clear BMX
                category. In order to condense information in the top navigation bar and allow for more bike options,
                add a dropdown under “bikes” with more categories.</li>
            <li>Adding a “You might also like” section would be nice.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="user">
        <h2>Zoe</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>She was also slightly confused by the featured section, and was not sure if clicking on the arrow and
                buttons would lead to different images of the same bike or different bikes altogether.</li>
            <li>There should be a breadcrumb navigation in the quiz, so that users can loop back to a certain question
                without having to press the back button multiple times.</li>
            <li>She was unsure how the compare function would work as this was not yet developed on my page, but would
                expect it to open a popup.</li>
            <li>She assumed the sort by section was limited to price sorting functionality, allowing users to sort by
                price high to low or vice versa.</li>
            <li>Some missing filters included age category, wheel size, and gender.</li>
            <li>Add a like feature to individual bike detail pages.</li>
            <li>She would expect the “find my size” to open up into a space that grows larger when you click. Because
                sizing was also included in the features below, it might be redundant.</li>
            <li>She liked how condensed the design of the details page is.</li>
            <li>Add color options.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="user">
        <h2>Krissy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>She first clicked on the city category from home page.</li>
            <li>She then sorted by price, height, best for urban.</li>
            <li>Was missing an option to sort by durability or ability to carry a lot of things.</li>
            <li>On the details page, add an option to change color of bike and a zoom in tool to see the photos up
                close.</li>
            <li>As a transporter, she would like to see some recommended add-ons for accessories that fit the bike. For
                example, if the bike has certain holes that can accommodate a basket.</li>
            <li>She would expect the compare feature to first open to a popup but can then go more detailed into a
                specific page.</li>
            <li>Might be nice to have a button to take you back to the top of the page.</li>
            <li>Reviews should be on its own at the very button. It’s a lot to click through to get to reviews and it is
                currently in a place she did not expect.</li>
        </ul>
